# face-recognition-bot
My first ever project :D

A reddit bot that recognizes the faces of celebrities in a submission and returns info on said celebrity.

For usage,

The bot takes in the inputs "!facerec (professionkeyword)=(numofpeople)"

profession keywords can be keywords such as "reality" as in Reality Star, or "actor" for Actors.

Example:

!facerec actor=1 singer=2
